# Tabbed Interface

This Tabbed Interface allows users to navigate between different content sections using tabs. The page has four tabs, with the first tab being active by default. When a user clicks on a different tab, the currently displayed content is hidden, and the selected tab's content is shown. Built with HTML and Tailwind CSS, this component is designed to provide a smooth user experience with a clean and responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** - For structuring the tab layout and content.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling the tabs and managing the active state, creating a responsive and visually appealing interface.
